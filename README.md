# batchFileRenamer
I made this app when I got tired renaming my shows with tons of episodes.

Instructions:
Drag a folder containing the episodes of your show to the app.

As you edit the episode the changes will occur across all that are selected. 
If you made a mistake press CTRL+Z

If you have a single or multiple episodes that need to be edited separately from other,
uncheck "check all" and select the episodes you wish to edit.

If you wish to add episode numbers in order of the loaded files add 00,
select it and then press the numerical button
